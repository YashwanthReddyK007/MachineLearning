📘 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data — data that includes both the input variables (X) and the output/target variable (y). The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs and make predictions on unseen data.

❓ What is Supervised Learning?

In supervised learning, the model learns from a training dataset that contains input-output pairs. The objective is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you input new data, the model can accurately predict the output.

Example: Predicting house prices based on size, location, etc.

🧠 Types of Supervised Learning

RegressionPredicts continuous values.Example: Predicting temperatures, stock prices.

ClassificationPredicts discrete labels.Example: Email spam detection, tumor classification.
